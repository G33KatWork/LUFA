 *  \mainpage General Information
 *
 *  Lightweight USB Framework for AVRs Library, written by Dean Camera. 
 *
 *  Originally based on the AT90USBKEY from Atmel, it is an open-source USB library for the USB-enabled AVR
 *  microcontrollers, released under the MIT license. It now supports a large number of USB AVR models and boards.
 *
 *  The library is currently in a stable release, suitable for download and incorporation into user projects for
 *  both host and device modes. For information about the project progression, check out my blog.
 *
 *  LUFA is written specifically for the free AVR-GCC compiler, and uses several GCC-only extensions to make the
 *  library API more streamlined and robust. You can download AVR-GCC for free in a convenient windows package, 
 *  from the the WinAVR website.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Demos Demos, Projects and Bootloaders
 *  The LUFA library ships with several different host and device demos, located in the /Demos/ subdirectory.
 *  If this directory is missing, please re-download the project from the project homepage.
 *
 *  Also included with the library are three fully functional bootloaders, located in the /Bootloaders/ subdirectory.
 *  The DFU class bootloader is compatible with Atmel's FLIP software or the open source dfu-programmer project, the
 *  CDC class (AVR109 protocol) is compatible with such open source software as AVRDUDE and AVR-OSP, and the TeensyLoader
 *  HID class bootloader is compatible with the software from PJRC (http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/index.html).
 *
 *  User-submitted projects are located in the /Projects/ subdirectory. If you wish to have your LUFA project included,
 *  please email it to the Library author.
