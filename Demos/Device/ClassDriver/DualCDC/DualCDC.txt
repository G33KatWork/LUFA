 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description: 
 *
 *  Dual Communications Device Class demonstration application.
 *  This gives a simple reference application for implementing
 *  a compound device with dual CDC functions acting as a pair
 *  of virtual serial ports. This demo uses Interface Association
 *  Descriptors to link together the pair of related CDC
 *  descriptors for each virtual serial port, which may not be
 *  supported in all OSes - Windows Vista is supported, as is
 *  XP (although the latter may need a hotfix to function).
 *  
 *  Joystick actions are transmitted to the host as strings
 *  through the first serial port. The device does not respond to
 *  serial data sent from the host in the first serial port.
 *  
 *  The second serial port echoes back data sent from the host.
 *  
 *  After running this demo for the first time on a new computer,
 *  you will need to supply the .INF file located in this demo
 *  project's directory as the device's driver when running under
 *  Windows. This will enable Windows to use its inbuilt CDC drivers,
 *  negating the need for custom drivers for the device. Other
 *  Operating Systems should automatically use their own inbuilt
 *  CDC-ACM drivers.
 *
 *  On 64 bit versions of Windows, the OS requires all drivers to
 *  be digitally signed before it will allow them to be installed. As
 *  Windows' own CDC driver (which the supplied INF file references)
 *  is not signed, you will need to reboot, press F8 before Windows
 *  begins to load and select "Disable Driver Signature Enforcement"
 *  to allow the CDC driver to install.
