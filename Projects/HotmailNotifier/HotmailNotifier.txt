 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description: 
 *
 *  Hotmail Email Notifier Project. This project is designed for the Busware BUI board, however it can run easily on any
 *  USB AVR. It consists of a host application (written in C#) and a device firmware which work together to provide a
 *  visual mail notification system via the board's RGB LED. While the sample host application uses the Windows Live
 *  Messenger API for its email notifications, the hardware simply adjusts the LED color based on bytes sent to it - thus
 *  with a little coding, this project can be adapted for any sort of visual notification.
 *
 *  To compile the host application, you will need Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 (the free Express edition should be
 *  sufficient) as well as a recent version of Windows Live Messenger installed. When run, you will need to set the COM port
 *  number used by the hardware on the host PC, whereupon the host will send new email notifications to the device.
