 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description: 
 *
 *  This is a virtual serial port to soft-UART converter, for use on the Atmel XPLAIN boards. This project replaces the firmware
 *  preloaded onto the XPLAIN's onboard AT90USB1287 microcontroller to act as a a UART-to-USB bridge between the device and the
 *  host. When inserted, the device will enumerate as a regular COM port on the host, which can then be opened and data exchanged
 *  between the XMEGA and Host as if the XMEGA was connected directly to the host's serial port.
 *
 *  After running this demo for the first time on a new computer, you will need to supply the .INF file located in this demo
 *  project's directory as the device's driver when running under Windows. This will enable Windows to use its inbuilt CDC drivers,
 *  negating the need for custom drivers for the device. Other Operating Systems should automatically use their own inbuilt CDC-ACM
 *  drivers.
 *
 *  \section SSec_Options Project Options
 *
 *  The following defines can be found in this demo, which can control the demo behaviour when defined, or changed in value.

 *    <td><b>Location:</b></td>
 *    <td><b>Description:</b></td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>BUFF_STATICSIZE</td>
 *    <td>RingBuff.h</td>
 *    <td>Defines the maximum number of bytes which can be buffered in each Ring Buffer.</td>
