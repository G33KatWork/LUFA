 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description: 
 *
 *  Simple HTTP webserver project. This project combines the LUFA library with the uIP TCP/IP full network stack, to create a
 *  RNDIS host capable of serving out HTTP webpages to up to 10 hosts simultaneously. This project demonstrates how the two
 *  libraries can be combined into a robust network enabled application, with the addition of a RNDIS network device.
 *
 *  To use this project, plug the USB AVR into a RNDIS class device, such as a USB (desktop) modem. If compatible, the project
 *  will enumerate the device, set the appropriate parameters needed for connectivity and begin listening for new HTTP connections
 *  on port 80. The device IP, netmask and default gateway IP must be set to values appropriate for the RNDIS device being used
 *  for this project to work.
 *
 *  When properly configured, the webserver can be accessed from any HTTP webrowser by typing in the device's IP address.
 *
 *  \section SSec_Options Project Options
